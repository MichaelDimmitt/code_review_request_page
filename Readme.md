## Simple implementation of design driven api npm [swaggerize-express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/swaggerize-express)

## Preliminary instructions, 
```
npm install -g yo
npm install -g generator-swaggerize
```

NOTE: now, generate an openapi.json [example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wordnik/swagger-spec/master/examples/v2.0/json/petstore.json)
NOTE: running yo swaggerize will prompt for such a document.
NOTE: programmers will look at the openapi.json to make changes 
NOTE: or understand the service

```
git clone https://github.com/MichaelDimmitt/simp-example-swaggerize-express.git;
cd simp-example-swaggerize-express
yo swaggerize

*when prompted input:* openapi.json
for testing purposes, answer all additional questions with "fred" -will still work.
cd fred
```

## How it works, 

#### Handler
```
  cd into (app name)
  cd into handler folder
  NOTE: handler folder is your request comes in and your response ships out.
  GET REQUESTS:
  request, stored as "req" comes from the url where key and value queries are communicated.
  response, stored as "res" 
```

#### Config and getting it running
```
by default config/swagger.json
has all the answers for the backend developer
this is your api 
or as the autogenerated readme declares, 
Swagger api [location](./fred/config/swagger.json)

  Three sections make up this example url, http://localhost:8000/v1/pets?limit=10

    base-url
      notice baseURL in this case is v1
    paths
      notice path in this case is pets
    parameters
      notice parameter in this case is 
      "name": "limit",

```

#### Running the application
```
cd fred 
open http://localhost:8000/v1/pets?limit=10; npm start

```
## Up next
```
  consuming these endpoints, I am considering keeping all of this in the same repo.
  the api autogenerates in a subfolder. 
    therefore the rationale is the consumer as an adjacent folder.

  eager for feedback.
  elsewise the consumer could exist in another repo.
```
