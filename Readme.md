## Simple implementation of design driven api npm [swaggerize-express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/swaggerize-express)

## Preliminary instructions, 
```
npm install -g yo
npm install -g generator-swaggerize
```

NOTE: now, generate an openapi.json [example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wordnik/swagger-spec/master/examples/v2.0/json/petstore.json)
NOTE: running yo swaggerize will prompt for such a document.
NOTE: programmers will look at the openapi.json to make changes 
NOTE: or understand the service

```
git clone https://github.com/MichaelDimmitt/simp-example-swaggerize-express.git;
cd simp-example-swaggerize-express
yo swaggerize

*when prompted input:* openapi.json
for testing purposes, answer all additional questions with "fred" -will still work.
cd fred
```

## How it works, 

#### Handler
```
  cd into (app name)
  cd into handler folder
  NOTE: handler folder is your request comes in and your response ships out.
  GET REQUESTS:
  request, stored as "req" comes from the url where key and value queries are communicated.
  response, stored as "res" 
```

#### Config and getting it running
```
by default config/swagger.json
has all the answers for the backend developer
this is your api 
or as the autogenerated readme declares, 
Swagger api [location](./fred/config/swagger.json)

  Three sections make up this example url, http://localhost:8000/v1/pets?limit=10

    base-url
      notice baseURL in this case is v1
    paths
      notice path in this case is pets
    parameters
      notice parameter in this case is 
      "name": "limit",

```

#### Running the application
```
cd fred 
open http://localhost:8000/v1/pets?limit=10; npm start

```
## Up next
```
  consuming these endpoints, I am considering keeping all of this in the same repo.
  the api autogenerates in a subfolder. 
    therefore the rationale is the consumer as an adjacent folder.

  eager for feedback.
  elsewise the consumer could exist in another repo.
```

## Additional Ramblings/ things you should know;
```
req ... comes in as an object whose keys can be accessed with "."'s

instead of the entire request object.
ofen req.query is used. req.pathname leads to the autocreated handler file and therefore not always required.
for your viewing purposes, a full req object availiable in the repo folder.

This is most simular to web scraping objects.
in that the whole object is not required but everything is given.

you can add a new handler by modifying config/swagger.json
adding the path and then adding the file that would correspond with that path.
```
